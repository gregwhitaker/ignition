Billing and Cost Management
===
Billing management enables you to create reports that break down your AWS costs by the hour, day, or month; or by each account in your organization; or by product or product resource; or by tags that you define.

The Billing and Cost Management scripts can be used to configure the following:

* Create S3 bucket to store detailed billing reports.

##setup-detailed-billing
Creates an S3 bucket to store detailed billing reports.

##teardown-detailed-billing
Deletes the S3 bucket that stores detailed billing reports.
